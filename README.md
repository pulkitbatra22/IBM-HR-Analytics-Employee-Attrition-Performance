# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance
This project integrates data engineering and analytics to understand and predict employee attrition. Leveraging a Kaggle dataset, the analysis encompasses extensive data preprocessing, EDA, and the creation of a predictive dashboard (Python Web Interface).

Key Features Data Engineering:
Cleaned and normalized data using Python and SQLite3. Employed SQL queries for efficient data manipulation. Data Analytics:

Developed an interactive Jupyter Notebook dashboard. Identified key variables influencing employee attrition. Utilized predictive modeling to assess attrition likelihood. 

Dashboard Highlights Interactivity: 
Dynamically navigate the dataset with interactive widgets. Set parameters to visualize employee attrition under different scenarios.

Dataset:
The Kaggle dataset provides insights into various factors affecting employee behavior, including job satisfaction, work-life balance, and job involvement.

Technologies:
Python for data analysis and visualization. SQLite3 for efficient data manipulation. Jupyter Notebook as the primary development environment.

Usage 
Could you clone the repository to your local machine? Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore, clean, and analyze the dataset. Interact with the dashboard to visualize and predict employee attrition based on different parameters.
